              Ten years ago (2013) in “Your Guide in Georgia” there were only
              two—Tamar and Fady. They held firm to their belief that their
              dream could come true. After the founders officially married, the
              company began taking shape. Our service has found popularity in
              social media, especially among Arab countries. We began to grow,
              bringing in new employees and an office. After conducting a tour
              for our first big group from Saudi Arabia, we began cooperating
              with many travel agencies for individual and group tours. Our
              guests are from India, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Oman, Kuwait,
              Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Syria, and Egypt. The company also
              registered as a VAT and TAX payer in 2020. Our company continues
              to develop our services, so that our esteemed guests enjoy the
              best memories while visiting Georgia.
